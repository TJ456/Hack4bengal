# ML Risk Assessment Timeout Fix

## Summary of Changes

We've identified and fixed the issue causing "ML risk assessment timed out" errors in the TransactionInterceptor component. Here's a summary of the changes made:

### 1. Improved ML API with Better Timeout Handling

- Updated the `predict_v2.py` file with a two-stage timeout approach:
  - First attempt with a shorter 10-second timeout
  - On timeout, automatic retry with a longer 20-second timeout
  - Proper error handling for all network-related issues
  - Smart fallback risk assessment when the ML service is unavailable

### 2. Enhanced Fallback Risk Assessment

When the ML service times out, the system now:
- Uses a smarter fallback risk assessment based on available transaction data
- Considers factors like contract interaction and transaction value
- Properly categorizes transactions with reasonable risk scores even without ML
- Clearly indicates when a fallback assessment is being used

### 3. Added Configuration File

- Created `api/config.js` with configurable timeout settings
- Made the API endpoint selection configurable
- Centralized configuration for easier maintenance

### 4. Key Fixes in Error Handling

- Proper abort controller integration for clean request cancellation
- Better error reporting and classification
- Improved logging for debugging
- Reliable detection of various error conditions

## Testing the Fix

To test that the fix works correctly:

1. When the ML service is working normally:
   - Transactions should be assessed quickly with the first 10-second timeout
   - Risk assessment should complete before transaction is processed

2. When the ML service is slow:
   - System will retry with a longer timeout
   - If successful on retry, assessment will be used normally

3. When the ML service is completely unavailable:
   - System will use the fallback risk assessment
   - Transaction still shows appropriate warnings
   - Clear indication that a fallback assessment is being used

4. Edge cases:
   - Network errors handled gracefully
   - JSON parsing errors handled properly
   - HTTP error codes from ML service handled correctly

The system now provides better security by ensuring transactions always wait for risk assessment, while also improving user experience by providing reasonable fallbacks when services are unavailable.
